            <p>To demonstrate collective effort and community spirit, the CTU Danao Campus, CTU Danao Multipurpose Cooperative, Extension Office, Graduate School Students' Organization (GRASSO) and Gender and Development Office adheres to its corporate social responsibility and successfully conducted a three-day outreach program in Barangay Daanbario, Carnaza, Daanbantayan, Cebu, from August 16-18, 2024. This initiative, conducted in partnership with the Carnaza Barangay Council and the Assembly of God Church, aims to address pressing community needs through various impactful activities.</p>
            <p>On day one, a courtesy call at the office of Barangay Captain Hon. Roquita Rosell was made possible, she warmly welcomed the CTU Danao Campus office heads, faculty and staff and expressed her support for the initiative. The courtesy call underscored the collaborative nature of the program and set a positive tone for the days ahead.</p>
            <p>One of the focal points of the outreach was dengue prevention. With dengue fever being a significant health concern in the country, the program featured educational sessions on preventive measures, symptom recognition, and effective ways to reduce mosquito breeding sites. CTU Danao Campus Head Nurse, Miss Reafil Pilapil provided valuable insights and distributed informational materials to help residents safeguard their health.</p>
            <p>Children in Barangay Carnaza received essential health kits, with items such as first aid supplies and hygiene products and they were also provided with school supplies to support their educational needs and enhance their learning experience. A feeding program was also a significant part of the outreach. Volunteers from the participating organizations, along with members of the Assembly of God Church, worked together to prepare and distribute the meals, ensuring that everyone had access to a warm afternoon snack.</p>
            <p>A major highlight of the program was the coastal clean-up activity at La Manok Island, CTU Danao Campus volunteers and representatives came together to remove litter and debris from the pristine shoreline. The clean-up effort not only contributed to the environmental preservation of La Manok Island but also fostered a sense of community responsibility towards maintaining the beauty and health of local natural resources.</p>
            <p>The collaboration among the CTU Danao Campus, CTU Multipurpose Cooperative, Extension Office, Graduate School Students’ Organization (GRASSO), Gender and Development Office and the Carnaza Barangay Council and the Assembly of God Church exemplified the power of partnership in addressing community challenges. The initiative provided tangible benefits to the residents of the barangay and demonstrated the positive impact of organized community service to improve the lives of individuals and the environment.</p>
